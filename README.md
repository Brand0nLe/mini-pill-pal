## FDA Drug Label API

The FDA Drug Label API provides access to drug label information, including names, strengths, dosage forms, and more. To use this API in the Medication Reminder App, you can visit the [FDA Drug Label API Documentation](https://api.fda.gov/drug/label) to learn more about the API and its capabilities.

For more details on using the FDA Drug Label API, refer to the [FDA Drug Label API Documentation](https://api.fda.gov/drug/label).

## Disclaimer

This project, Mini Pill Pal, is a personal and educational endeavor. It utilizes the FDA Drug Label API to fetch drug information, but the app itself is not affiliated with or endorsed by the FDA. This project is purely for the purpose of practicing and developing my skills in front-end development, with a focus on React.js and TypeScript. It is also an exercise in learning to integrate and use third-party APIs. All medication information is provided by the FDA Drug Label API, and this application claims no ownership or responsibility for this data.

As this is a personal project to develop my skills, there are no plans for commercial use.
